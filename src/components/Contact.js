          If your company needs help with technical IP projects but doesn&apos;t
          have the capacity to hire a full time employee, please do not hesitate
          to reach out! Both mid-sized companies with commercial products and
          start-ups seeking their next round of funding are welcome. I am
          selective in the work I take on to avoid any conflicts, and I will let
          you know upfront if I can help.
